//Design and implement a class called Flight that represents an
//airline flight. It should contain instance data that represents the
//airline name, flight number, and the flightâ€™s origin and destination
//cities. Define the Flight constructor to accept and initialize all
//instance data. Include getter and setter methods for all instance
//data. Include a toString method that returns a one-line description of the flight.
//Create a driver class called FlightTest, whose
//main method instantiates and updates several Flight objects.
